# Default example

A default example that uses the module's default variable values.

This example uses the parent VPE module to create this infrastructure:
 - A resource group, if one is not passed in.
 - A VPC, if one is not passed in.
 - A security group, if one is not passed in
 - Security group rules with CIDR blocks in a security group
 - Security group rules with an existing security group in a security group

<!-- Add your example and link to it from the module's main readme file. -->
