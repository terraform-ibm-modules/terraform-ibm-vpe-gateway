# Configuring complex inputs for Virtual Private Endpoint Gateways

IBM CloudÂ® Virtual Private Endpoints (VPE) for VPC enables you to connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your Virtual Privte Cloud (VPC) network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, allocated from a subnet within your VPC. For more details about Virtual Private Endpoint Gateways please refer to this [documentation page](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe)

In order to create and configure the Virtual Private Endpoint gateways in your VPC to connect to the IBM Cloud services you choose, this architecture requires you to configure a set of optional input variables defined through complex object types.

- [cloud_services](#cloud-services) : this input parameter allows to create a VPE gateway to a IBM Cloud service by specifying its service name
- [cloud_service_by_crn](#cloud-service-by-crn) : this input parameter allows to create a VPE gateway to a IBM Cloud service its service CRN (Cloud Resource Name)

For more details about the IBM Cloud services, their VPE configuration information and about creating the same gateways to Non-IBM Cloud services please refer to [this documentation page](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-supported-services)

As alternative, you can use the CLI command `ibmcloud is endpoint-gateway-targets` to retrieve the list of IBM Cloud services supported in a specific region, including the services' names and their CRNs

## VPE gateway to Cloud Services by service name <a name="cloud-services"></a>

By setting up this input parameter you can create VPE gateways in your VPC instance by specifying the name of the IBM Cloud services.

**Important note: ** you can use this structure only for IBM Cloud services offering global service endpoints.

- Variable name: `cloud_services`.
- Type: A list of objects that represent IBM Cloud services with attributes `service_name`, `vpe_name` and `allow_dns_resolution_binding`
- Default value: the default value is an empty list (`[]`)

### cloud_service attributes

- `service_name` (mandatory): The IBM Cloud service name as per [this documentation page](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-supported-services))or the name value returned by the CLI command `ibmcloud is endpoint-gateway-targets`
- `vpe_name` (optional): The desired name to assigne to the VPE gateway. If not specified, the VPE name will be computed based on prefix, vpc name and service name.
- `allow_dns_resolution_binding` (optional): Indicates whether to allow this endpoint gateway to participate in DNS resolution bindings. For more details please refer to this [documentation page](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-dns-sharing-configure-hub&interface=ui). If not set default value is `true`.

### Example for cloud_services input parameter

```hcl
cloud_services = [
  {
    "service_name": "global-search-tagging",
    "vpe_name": "global-search-gateway",
    "allow_dns_resolution_binding": false
  },
  {
    "service_name": "cloud-object-storage"
  }
]
```

## VPE gateway to Cloud Services by service CRN <a name="cloud-service-by-crn"></a>

By setting up this input parameter you can create VPE gateways in your VPC instance by specifying the IBM Cloud services CRNs.

- Variable name: `cloud_service_by_crn`.
- Type: A list of objects that represent IBM Cloud services with attributes `crn`, `vpe_name`, `service_name` and `allow_dns_resolution_binding`
- Default value: the default value is an empty list (`[]`)

### Options for cloud_service_by_crn

- `crn` (mandatory): IBM Cloud service CRN as per [this documentation page](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-supported-services))or the CRN value returned by the CLI command `ibmcloud is endpoint-gateway-targets`
- `vpe_name` (optional): The desired name to assigne to the VPE gateway. If not specified, the VPE name will be computed based on prefix, vpc name and service name.
- `service_name` (optional): The name of the service used to compute the name of the VPE gateway. If not provided the name is extracted from the CRN.
- `allow_dns_resolution_binding` (optional): Indicates whether to allow this endpoint gateway to participate in DNS resolution bindings. For more details please refer to this [documentation page](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-dns-sharing-configure-hub&interface=ui). If not set default value is `true`.

### Example for cloud_service_by_crn

```hcl
cloud_service_by_crn = [
  {
    "crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:kms:eu-es:::endpoint:private.eu-es.kms.cloud.ibm.com",
    "vpe_name": "kms-eu-es-gateway",
    "service_name": "kms",
    "allow_dns_resolution_binding": false
  },
  {
    "crn": " crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-svcs:global:::endpoint:private.iam.cloud.ibm.com"
  }
]
```
